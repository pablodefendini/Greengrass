# Executive Summary

Progressive/left-wing movements often struggle with limited resources, outdated tools, and fragmented technology solutions, especially in the global south. **GreenGrass** is a comprehensive, integrated technology platform designed specifically to empower grassroots political campaigns in the Global South, providing the tools needed for effective organizing, digital engagement, and data-driven decision-making. Built with a focus on affordability, accessibility, and local needs, GreenGrass aims to revolutionize political campaigning by streamlining operations and enhancing community engagement.

Progressive political campaigns in Global South countries face unique challenges, including:

* **Limited Access to Digital Tools:** Most political technology platforms are designed for developed markets, with high costs and steep learning curves that make them inaccessible to grassroots campaigns.   
* **Fragmented Communication Channels:** Campaigns often rely on a mix of disparate tools for email, social media, and SMS, leading to inconsistent messaging, inefficient use of resources, and burgeoning costs.  
* **Inefficient Voter Engagement:** Many campaigns lack the ability to track and segment voter data effectively, resulting in generic outreach that fails to resonate with their constituencies.  
* **Resource Constraints:** Campaigns often operate on tight budgets, limiting their ability to invest in high-quality software solutions.

While platforms like NationBuilder, Action Network, and Mobilize exist, they are designed for developed markets and often priced out of reach for progressive campaigns in the Global South.

# Project: GreenGrass

**Project: GreenGrass** is an all-in-one campaign technology platform tailored specifically for the needs of grassroots campaigns in countries in the Global South. It’s intended to be a one-stop-shop—with one set fee—so that campaigns and organizations can use the service without having to depend on additional services or costs (with the exception of unavoidable variable costs such as SMS sends, which are usually billed by volume by the supplier).

The product combines a Constituent Relationship Manager (CRM), a voter database, fundraising tools, communication tools, and data analytics into a single, affordable solution, designed to maximize impact and streamline operations. 

GreenGrass is web- and mobile-first. The application is progressively enhanced and optimized for low-bandwidth and mobile-first environments.

* Explicit login access for *everyone*, with easy-to manage account preferences.

### Fundraising Tools

* Donation forms, with the ability to manage recurring and one-time donations, as well as the ability to have the donor take on credit card processing fees, and the ability to prompt for specific donation amounts  
* Multiple payment processors (and local payment vendors—ATH Movil, Venmo, Zelle, etc), which will vary by region.   
* A way to register/track cash donations (esp during in-person events)

## Table-stakes features

* Accessibility and Affordability: GreenGrass offers a tiered pricing model, including a freemium plan and a no-credit-card-necessary trial period for smaller campaigns, making it accessible even for campaigns with minimal budgets.  
* Local Language Support: The platform supports multiple languages and local dialects, ensuring accessibility for diverse communities.  
* Offline Functionality: Designed for areas with unreliable internet access, key features of GreenGrass can function offline and sync data when connectivity is restored.  
* Mobile-First Design: Recognizing the worldwide prevalence of mobile internet usage, the platform is optimized for mobile devices.

## High-level Architecture notes

GreenGrass is built using an Open Source model, except where security or technical concerns make that approach unworkable. It also employs a single-tenant architecture. That is, a single instance of the application and its supporting infrastructure is dedicated to serving each customer (or tenant). Each tenant operates in isolation, with its own database, application, and resources, ensuring complete separation from other tenants. While this approach complicates deployment and version control at a high level, single-tenant systems prioritize security, performance, and customization for individual users or organizations. 

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 0: Buy-in (3-6 months)

* Define and refine product proposal, feature set, initial road map, and proposed business models  
* Identify and onboard three to five alpha clients, who are interested in the product, and will commit to paying for an MVP once it’s ready.

### Phase 1: Product Development (10 Months)

* Finalize feature set and begin development of core components.  
* Conduct user testing with alpha clients, select campaigns and/or stakeholders to gather feedback and refine the product.

### Phase 2: Pilot Program (10 Months)

* Launch a pilot program with alpha clients and/or partner campaigns in three target countries, providing training and support.  
* Collect data on usage, performance, and user feedback to further improve the platform.

### Phase 3: Full Launch and Scaling (6 Months and beyond)

* Roll out the platform to a broader audience with a focus on countries in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia.  
* Implement a local support network with partnerships to provide training and customer service in key regions.

## Possible Revenue Models

* Freemium Plan: Basic access to core features, allowing small campaigns to get started for free.  
* Subscription Tiers: Paid plans with additional features designed for mid-sized and large campaigns. Explicitly not a per-user, or other scale-based pricing model, although we should still think about some kind of scale-based revenue structure in order to manage growing operating costs.  
* Partnerships: Revenue from partnerships with NGOs, political training organizations, and advocacy groups who can license the platform for their networks.  
* Bespoke services: development of integrations, data query creation and analysis, data enrichment, custom report generation.
