# Screen Inventory

## Purpose

A comprehensive catalog of every distinct screen in the platform, organized by feature area. Each entry identifies which personas can access the screen, whether it works offline, and whether it's mobile-optimized.

This inventory is derived from the 12 spec documents and the navigation model. It serves as the master reference for wireframing, route planning, and implementation scoping.

## Reading the Table

- **Screen ID** — unique identifier for cross-referencing (format: `AREA-NNN`)
- **Screen** — human-readable screen name
- **Personas** — who can access this screen (abbreviated: OA=Org Admin, CD=Communications Director, FD=Finance Director, FiD=Field Director, VC=Volunteer Coordinator, DM=Data Manager, V=Volunteer, TL=Team Lead, C=Candidate, S=Supporter)
- **Offline** — whether the screen works without connectivity (Yes, Partial, No)
- **Mobile** — whether the screen is designed for mobile use (Primary=mobile-first, Yes=works on mobile, Desktop=desktop-preferred)
- **Spec ref** — source spec document and relevant section

The platform has approximately **236 distinct screens**, of which **24 work offline** and **53 are mobile-primary** (designed primarily for phone use). The remaining screens work on mobile but are designed desktop-first (complex configuration, data tables, builders).

<!-- REVISIT: This inventory will grow as implementation reveals sub-screens and modal flows not captured at this level of analysis. The screen IDs provide a stable reference system for additions. -->
