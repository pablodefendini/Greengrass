## Format

These wireframes are written as detailed ASCII specifications — implementation-ready screen descriptions with box-drawing wireframes, state definitions, interaction specs, and responsive behavior notes.

They serve as the bridge between the design system foundations (Phase 3) and visual design. Each document can be directly translated into high-fidelity mockups in Paper or Figma, or used as specs for component implementation.

## Reading Order

1. **Navigation shell first** — the global frame everything lives inside
2. **Dashboards** — each persona's home screen
3. **Field mode** — the highest-risk UX, most detailed wireframes
4. **Onboarding** — first impressions for new users
5. **Messaging** — internal coordination
6. **Supporter portal** — public-facing donor experience
7. **Alliance** — cross-org coordination and shared operations
8. **CRM / People** — the data layer everything else builds on
9. **Field operations (admin)** — planning, configuration, and review for canvassing, phone banking, and voter registration
10. **Fundraising (admin)** — donation management, form building, compliance, cash handling, alliance splits, payment processors
11. **Communications** — email campaigns, SMS/WhatsApp, templates, analytics, consent management
12. **Social media** — post composition, scheduling, analytics, account management
13. **Events** — event lifecycle, check-in, metrics, virtual events, post-event surveys
14. **Press & media** — media contacts, press content, coverage tracking, endorsements, talking points, interviews
15. **Activism** — letter/email actions with AI-generated messages, petitions, public comment campaigns, delivery documentation
16. **GOTV (admin)** — pre-election setup (universe, early voting, staging, turfs, comms plan, poll watchers), election day ops (turnout tracking, ride dispatch, issue queue, reallocation), election night (results entry + dashboard), post-election analysis
17. **Settings & admin** — org branding, roles & permissions, staff management, campaign config, compliance, integrations, billing, security, encryption keys, API keys, webhooks, audit trail
18. **Authentication** — passkey-first login, fallback (magic link, SMS OTP), account recovery via trusted contacts, passkey registration, device authorization, session management
19. **User profile** — personal settings, notification preferences, security (personal), language preference, tenant switching
20. **Support & help** — knowledge base, AI concierge chat, volunteer training modules with quizzes and certification, training content editor
21. **Public pages** — candidate profile, org profile, volunteer signup, media kit (plus cross-references to supporter portal, events, activism)
