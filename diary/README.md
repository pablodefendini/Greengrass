# Project Diary

This directory contains a chronological diary of building GreenGrass — written as the project progresses, intended to be turned into a series of blog posts.

The diary captures the process, decisions, surprises, and lessons learned from designing a complex platform for grassroots political elections in the global south, built almost entirely through conversation with Claude Code.

## Entries

1. **[From Description to Specification](01-from-description-to-specification.md)** — Starting with a product description and turning it into 12 interconnected spec documents. How conversational AI handles ambiguity, forces decisions, and surfaces gaps.

2. **[The Architecture Session](02-the-architecture-session.md)** — System architecture as a conversation. From product constraints to technology choices in a single session.

3. **[Information Architecture](03-information-architecture.md)** — Designing the UX skeleton for 10 personas, 236 screens, and a platform that works offline on low-end phones.

4. **[The Design System and Wireframes](04-design-system-and-wireframes.md)** — Building a visual language before having a brand. System fonts over custom fonts, 8px grids, theming as a cascade, and why ASCII wireframes work better than expected.

5. **[The Wireframe Audit](05-the-wireframe-audit.md)** — Auditing 21 wireframe documents for consistency, normalizing 9 early-batch docs to a standard structure, filling 15 missing wireframes, and making implicit conventions explicit.

6. **[Resolving the Open Questions](06-resolving-the-open-questions.md)** — Systematically resolving all 89 open questions from the wireframe audit. Cross-cutting policies first (data retention, channel orchestration), then category by category. BYOM emerges from an AI question, v2 tentpoles identified.

7. **[Reconciling the Architecture](07-reconciling-the-architecture.md)** — Updating the system architecture document to reflect ADR-016 decisions. 22 changes: 2 new sections (Data Retention, Election Day), 1 rewrite (AI Integration for BYOM), 19 augmentations. The BYOK + BYOM tension documented.

8. **[Housekeeping](08-housekeeping.md)** — Documentation audit and consistency fixes. Stale READMEs, scrambled numbering in the UX overview, missing diary entries. Creating a memory file for session persistence. The project is now ready for implementation.

9. **[The Documentation Website](09-the-documentation-website.md)** — Turning ~80 Markdown files into a browsable website with a sidebar table of contents. A custom static generator over a docs framework, styled with GreenGrass's own design tokens. How the build became an audit and caught 33 broken links, and why the Markdown stays canonical while the site is just the front door.
