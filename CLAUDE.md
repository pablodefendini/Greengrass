# GreenGrass

## Project Overview

GreenGrass is a custom platform for managing grassroots political elections in the global south. It is designed around the realities of resource-constrained environments, intermittent connectivity, multilingual populations, and decentralized organizing structures.

## Project Phase

**Current phase: Specification & Design (complete)**

All spec and design work is done. The project is ready for implementation.

Completed phases:
1. **Product definition** — 12 spec documents covering product, users, workflows, security, compliance, etc.
2. **UX design** — 37 documents: information architecture, global patterns, design system, 21 wireframes (236 screens)
3. **Architecture** — system architecture document, 16 ADRs formalizing all decisions

The Markdown sources are canonical. `docs/` is generated from them by `npm run build`
(see the README's "Documentation Website" section) and published to GitHub Pages.

## Conventions

- All spec documents are Markdown
- Use plain, direct language — avoid jargon where possible
- Design for offline-first, low-bandwidth, multilingual contexts
- Decisions are recorded as ADRs in `decisions/`
- Each spec document should be self-contained but cross-reference related docs
- The `docs/` website is generated — edit the Markdown sources, then run `npm run build` to regenerate it; never hand-edit files in `docs/`

## Notes

- The target context is grassroots political elections in the global south
- Key constraints: intermittent connectivity, low-end devices, multilingual users, decentralized organizations, security sensitivity
- The platform must be trustworthy and transparent — election integrity is paramount
